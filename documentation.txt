To compile our final project, please download all the source code from cs50.net/submit. Save the source code into a folder called "finalproject"
in your vhosts folder. Then, go to a web browser of your choosing, navigate to http://finalproject/phpmyadmin, and import the file called 
bettereats.sql.zip. Once you do that, the website should be ready to go!

To visit the website, go to a web browser and type in http://finalproject. This should lead you directly to our home page, where you will see 
a brief description of the website on the left side of the screen, the main content in the middle, and a search bar on the right. Navigation 
tabs along the top of the screen allow users to visit different pages of the website. The home page displays all submitted recipes. You can search 
for recipes by ingredient, tag, or keyword using the search bar on the right. 

To submit a recipe of your own, click on the "submit a recipe" tab on the navigation bar. This should lead you to a form. You can include all the 
necessary information about your recipe on the form. Check off ingredients or tags to include them in your recipe. Once you submit the recipe, the 
website will notify you of its successful submission. Then, you can go to the home page - by clicking on the "browse recipes" tab or on the logo at 
the top of the screen - to view your recipe. If you want to include ingredients that are not listed on the form, you may send us an email. You can 
also email us about any other questions, comments, or concerns about the website. Our contact information can be found on the "contact us" tab of 
the navigation bar. We hope you enjoy using our website!
